# More chatting with AI and getting back to blogging

I saw this post on reddit: [I asked ChatGPT the top ten things humanity should know](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ldy7zs/i_asked_chatgpt_the_top_ten_things_humanity/) and clicked for the interesting concept.

People posting the results of their musings with ChatGPT and other LLMs is always interesting to me at a meta level.

I wonder if they know that their personality and neuroses come through in the AI responses they share - because it hints at the conversations they've had in the past. Itâ€™s like peeking into someoneâ€™s internal monologue.

So anyway I scrolled past the paranoid doompost to the comments digging for treasure and I found [this comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ldy7zs/comment/mycctn1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

It all seemed a little pointless. Interesting, sure. But nothing ground breaking. I thought I could ask something a bit better and point the novelty in a more productive direction.

## **What are the top 10 things I should know**
<br>

# ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬**ChatGPT said:**
Here are 10 high-leverage things worth knowing â€” across life, tech, and systems thinking â€” chosen to be practical, broadly applicable, and deeply useful:

1. Compound Interest Applies to Everything
Not just money â€” habits, skills, relationships, health, knowledge. Tiny consistent effort â†’ massive results over time.

2. Youâ€™re Running on a Predictive Brain
Your brain guesses what will happen next and fills in gaps â€” this drives perception, emotion, and most cognitive bias. Learn to doubt your first reaction.

3. Mental Energy Is a Scarce Resource
Make fewer decisions, reduce friction, and automate where you can (e.g. routines, tools, checklists). Save focus for high-leverage moves.

4. All Systems Are Incentive Systems
Companies, governments, software, even friendships â€” follow the incentives to understand behavior. If it doesn't make sense, you're missing a motivator.

5. The World Runs on APIs and Protocols
Understanding interfaces â€” in tech (APIs), in people (social scripts), in systems (contracts) â€” gives you leverage to plug into and manipulate structures.

6. Writing Is Thinking
Journaling, explaining, or note-taking helps clarify your own mind. If it's fuzzy on the page, it's fuzzy in your head.

7. Attention Is the Real Currency
What you focus on shapes your reality and your outcomes. Guard it. Filter ruthlessly. This includes news, social feeds, even friend groups.

8. People Donâ€™t Care What You Know Until They Know You Care
Emotional intelligence > pure intellect in most human systems. Learn to read people, defuse tension, and build trust â€” especially in high-stakes settings.

9. Reality Is Laggy
Inputs donâ€™t show immediate results. Systems have inertia. Keep acting even when results arenâ€™t visible yet â€” this applies to fitness, learning, projects, and culture change.

10. Be Directionally Correct, Then Iterate
Perfect plans are a trap. Start with a strong bias for action. Course-correct faster than others. Execution speed compounds.

If you want a version of this tuned for a specific context (tech career, relationships, freelance life, creative work, etc.), just say the word.
